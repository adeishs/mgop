How to Pay for This Article
===========================

If you have paid for this article, thank you and you can jump to
:doc:`end credits <end-credits>`. If not, …

Have you found this article useful? If you have, please understand that
I have spent my time and energy to produce this and I would appreciate
one or more of the following:

#. **Buy my merch**. Go to my Bandcamp site
   `adeishs.bandcamp.com <https://adeishs.bandcamp.com>`_.
#. **Watch my ticketed gigs**. Subscribe to `my mailing list
   <https://lists.adeishs.com>`_ to find out when and where I’m
   playing next.
#. **Book me a gig**. Fish or fishing pole, I’m grateful for both.
#. **Donate** and get my music as well. Go to my Bandcamp site
   `adeishs.bandcamp.com <https://adeishs.bandcamp.com>`_ and buy any of my music.
   If you happen to have all, you can gift it to others.
#. **Broadcast my music** if you’re a radio DJ, TV programme host, etc.
   Anything that makes royalty money trickles into my bank account.
#. **Stream my music**. You can also stream my music via the likes of `Spotify
   <https://open.spotify.com/artist/6XGsTZemBHjHOUf9LOs3l1>`_, `YouTube
   <https://youtube.com/adeishs>`_, and others.
   
   I have to be honest, though, that at the moment, they pay next to nothing.

   If you choose to do this, I’m asking you to at least help me by also
   including my tracks in your playlist and getting your friends to do the same.

You might think, ‘Hang on a sec. I’m already reading this. There’s no
paywall. I can even share this to my friends.’

You’re right. I believe that people (most of them, at least) are decent.
I don’t want to punish decent people by putting unnecessary hurdles.

You’re just beginning your music career and you haven’t made any profit
or you’re still owing other people money? I understand. All the best to
you, and you can pay me later. Just don’t forget about it, OK?

In the meantime, like/subscribe/follow me on `Facebook
<https://facebook.com/adeishs>`_, `YouTube <https://youtube.com/adeishs>`_, and
`Instagram <https://instagram.com/adeishs>`_ and ask your friends to do so as
well. Doing those is free.

Please do the right thing. Support art. Support artists. I trust that
you do it.
