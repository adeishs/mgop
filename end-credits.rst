About ade ishs
--------------

I’m a musician, computer scientist, and software developer.

In the past, I was also a magazine typesetter, magazine columnist,
photographer, interpreter, high school tutor, university tutor,
lecturer, researcher, and probably others I don’t remember.

While working on my undergraduate study in physics at Universitas
Indonesia’s Faculty of Mathematics and Science, I developed the first
incarnation of the faculty website.

For its launch event, I had my synth keyboard play a tune that I wrote
when I was about 13 years old called *Science* (it was later recorded by
The ishs/Allen Project in 2015). Since one year before I graduated, I
had started building commercial websites.

Looking for a change in life, I went to Melbourne, Australia, initially
to study computer science at RMIT. Their campus at Melbourne CBD had an
out-of-tune piano for hire.

While studying there, I met musician and computer scientist Sandra
Uitdenbogerd, under whose supervision I wrote theses in music
information retrieval and published a few conference papers and journal
articles (we did some music gigs together, too).

After using up three scholarships, I ended up becoming a PhD. After my
graduation, I got a few invitations to give guest lectures.

I compose tunes and play mainly the piano. You can find much
improvisation in my music, but not always. I also love playing solo
piano. My current main outfits are *ade ishs Trio*, *eMotion Band*, and
*The Bridge*.

I live in Melbourne with my beautiful wife Fety Aryani, our lovely kids
Daud, Yunus, and Zainab Ishs, and our adorable cats Emily and Maclorius.
