Domain Name
===========

Why have your own domain name? Tell me, if you need to put one of these
addresses in your gig poster, which one looks best? (This example
contains a blatant plug.)

#. `www.someisp.net.au/users/adeishs <#>`_
#. `www.freehosting.com/adeishs <#>`_
#. `www.adeishs.com <https://www.adeishs.com>`_

Exactly. You need to have your own domain name. How to choose your
domain name? Obviously, it must be something that hasn’t been owned by
someone else.

Now, there are many top-level domains (TLDs) you can choose. In the
old days, we only had the likes of ``.com``, ``.net``, ``.org``, and others
including country code TLDs such as ``.co.id``, ``.net.au``, and
``.to``.

These days, we also have geographic TLDs like ``.melbourne`` and
``.asia``, and what we call ICANN-era TLDs (for the acronym lovers:
ICANN is `Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
Numbers <https://icann.org>`_). Included in these are
``.band`` and ``.guitars``. See `IANA TLD list
<https://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt>`_.

Which one should you get? There’s no hard fast rule for that. You know
your own niche and how you want to be perceived better than I do.

How do you get one? There are many organisations that sell domain names.
They are called *domain registrars*.

As at now, I personally use and recommend
`VentraIP <https://ventraip.com.au>`_ because I find them the easiest to
use and the prices are reasonable.

You might have noticed that some website hosting companies
(discussed in the :doc:`‘Website’ section <website>`)
offer a ‘free’ domain name if you use their service. Personally, I
prefer putting things in different baskets and not getting locked in,
and for those reasons, I decline the ‘free’ offer. The cost of domain
name is very little compared to other components anyway.

I put quotes surrounding ‘free’ because it’s not really free. They only
‘give’ it to you if you use their service.

In the past, I used this, and when I wanted to terminate the website
hosting service, I had to also transfer the domain name to another
registrar. It was a bit more hassle as well.

Got your domain name already? Excellent. Now you’re ready to build a
website with the domain name that looks shiny on your gig posters.
