Music and Video
===============

Now, you need somewhere to host your media files. In the music industry,
we’re talking about audio and video.

You can just upload it to wherever you host your website, right? Yes and
no. Yes, if you can afford to pay the space and also the bandwidth to
serve the content. I see. You’re thinking otherwise now.

I recommend just using the services that are specialised for the media
types. Let me tell you why:

#. Their infrastructure is optimal for the media type they’re serving.
   For example, YouTube and Vimeo are optimal for videos.
#. You can embed the content on your website.
#. People flock there. Including fans and booking managers. I have got
   countless questions from booking managers and festival organisers,
   ‘Can you tell me your YouTube link?’
#. Social media recognise links belonging to these services and know
   how to present your media nicely. Chances are if you paste a
   Bandcamp link to Facebook, your timeline will contain the artwork
   with a play button.

For videos, `YouTube <https://youtube.com>`_ and
`Vimeo <https://vimeo.com>`_ are very popular. You can also put links on your
video pages.
