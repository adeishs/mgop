Online Shop
===========

Some people prefer buying your music directly from you when you’re doing
a gig. Some others don’t have that option, because they live half a
continent away from where you do your gigs.

There are many ways to run your online shop. However, you need to spend
time analysing which one would work well for you. Your :doc:`website hosting
<website>` may have an online shop feature (probably at an extra cost).

Alternatively, you can host it elsewhere. If your web hosting provider
allows it, you can install an e-commerce application and customise it.
If you’re tech savvy, you can even write your own.

What’s the main thing involved in a shop?

Transaction.

Payment.

You need a way so that your customer’s money goes to you. You need a
payment processor. `PayPal <https://www.paypal.com>`_ and
`Stripe <https://www.stripe.com>`_ are popular, and there are various
others. Search for them. There are many.

Know your audience:

What’s the main currency you’ll be using to sell your music and merch?

Where is your biggest fan base?

If 90% of your audience is in Australia, it would make sense to
accept AUD. Some online shop providers can help you accept payments in
multiple currencies.

If you also sell to other countries, can your online shop provider
support multiple postage costs?

What are you selling?

CDs?

Digital audio downloads (what formats)?

Digital music sheets?

T-shirts?

Guitar picks?

You need to know whether they will be supported by whatever software
runs your shop.

Again, assess your needs and budget to find the right one for you.

You also need to check various requirements outside your control, like
freight and tax. If necessary, ask the local authorities where you do
your business, e.g. Australia Post and ATO in Australia.

At the moment, I use `Bandcamp <https://bandcamp.com>`_ for
`my online shop <https://adeishs.bandcamp.com>`_.
It doesn’t support all currencies under the sun, but more than what I need.

Your customer can buy your merch (you need to maintain your own stock, or you
can give access to your fulfilment partner) and download your music (in so
many formats, including FLAC and high-quality MP3).
You can also run a promo period where you offer a discount code for
certain products.

One thing that would be nice but `Bandcamp <https://bandcamp.com>`_ can’t
do at the moment is selling digital music sheets. Well, you can do that,
but the digital music sheets must be tied with albums.

If you want your customer to pay for albums and music sheets separately,
you can’t do it at `Bandcamp <https://www.bandcamp.com>`_. (Not yet, at
least.) One alternative I have found is `Music
Glue <https://www.musicglue.com>`_.

Some boutique music shops in your town may offer consignment deals with
you and put your CD on their online shop. You can then put link to your
music pages on these websites from your discography page.
