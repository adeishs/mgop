Summary
=======

After reading about the various components required for your online
presence, do you feel that the whole thing is daunting? Do you still
feel unsure about where to begin?

Don’t feel bad. I felt the same way in the beginning. One thing that
worked for me was copying what other people did. Up to now, I evaluate
what works and what doesn’t.

The following is a summary of my current setup. Feel free to copy all,
some, or none that I do.

=================  ========================
**Component**       **Service Provider**
=================  ========================
**Domain name**     VentraIP
**Website**         DreamHost + Cloudflare
**Email**           FastMail
**Video**           YouTube
**Mailing list**    Mailchimp
**Online shop**     Bandcamp
=================  ========================

Note that things were different in the past. For examples, before 
switching to FastMail, I used Gmail. These can change again the future.

Again, you know what you need. Choose products/services accordingly.
