Musician’s Guide to Online Presence
###################################

You’re a musician. In the Internet age. You’re not as legendary as Lyle
Mays. Face it. You need to have an online presence.

Why?

You want to get booked for gigs.

You want to collaborate with other musicians.

You want to connect with your followers.

Bottom-line, you are serious about your craft and you want to convey to
your audience that you mean it. You need to have an online presence.

I’m a musician as well. I have met many working musicians.

When it comes to online presence, many of them don’t know where to start
and at the same time don’t have the budget to pay someone else to do it
for them. That’s why I publish this concise, no-non-sense do-it-yourself
guide.

Instead of writing a step-by-step guide on how to use tools and
products, I give pointers here. There are so many tools and products in
the market I can’t write a guide for each one of them.

The idea here is that you know your own circumstances and you can make
decisions that are suitable for you. I’ll tell you what I use, but you
should do your own research.

Although this article is publicly available and not behind any
paywall, I expect some donation. I have spent a lot of time and energy
to produce it. So, go ahead and read this. If you find it useful,
