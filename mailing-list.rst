Mailing List
============

You already have followers. They want to hear about you. You need to
tell them. Here’s where a mailing list comes to play.

I still see some fellow musicians manually pasting the email addresses
of their fans. That’s error-prone, and you can risk yourself being
labelled as a spammer. Listen to me: Don’t.

Use an email marketing service provider. There are many. I have got
emails sent via `FanBridge <https://www.fanbridge.com>`_ and
`ReverbNation <https://www.reverbnation.com>`_. The one I’m personally
using and recommending is `MailChimp <https://www.mailchimp.com>`_.

See if the service you choose allows you to embed a subscription form on
your website. If it does, use it.
