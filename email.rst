Email
=====

These days, it’s easy to get your own email address and storage. There
are many free email service providers: Gmail, Outlook.com, and so on.
It’s probably OK to use something like ``pat.metheny@outlook.com``. I’ve
seen a well-known venue use something like ``emilys.jazz.cafe@gmail.com``.

However, you look more serious if your email address ends with something
like ``@myband.rocks``. It certainly means that you have invested a little
bit more money in your own work.

Also, if you are ``ben.williams.bass@gmail.com``, you risk losing emails
to ``ben.williams@gmail.com`` just because the booking agent feels macho
enough to rely on their broken memory.

How about ISP email addresses like ``chris.potter@bestisp.online``? Don’t
they also imply that the owner pays something? Here are why you
shouldn’t:

* When you switch to another provider, you’ll most likely lose that
  address.

* The suffix tells more about you being a customer of that ISP rather
  than a musician. Your most die-hard fan is probably interested in
  what ISP you use. The vast majority isn’t.

Also, if you have your own domain name, you can have something like
``you@your.band``, ``sales@your.band``, ``antonio.sanchez@your.band``,
anything you like.

If you like Gmail, there’s a paid version of Gmail that allows you to
use your own domain name (`<https://apps.google.com>`_).

The service I’m currently using and recommending is Melbourne-based
`FastMail <https://www.fastmail.com>`_.
`Hover <https://www.hover.com/email>`_ can also do it, but I’ve never used
it.

Like domain names, many web hosting service providers also include email
hosting. Before you use it, you need to ask yourself this question, ‘Do
you want to miss gig bookings?’

No? Again, here I also recommend separating the two. If your web hosting
service is down, at least the email service doesn’t get taken down
together.

Services that often come together with email are address book and
calendar. While it is possible to separate email, address book, and
calendar, and I generally recommend separating services, this is an
exception where I am willing to combine the three.

Email, address book, and spam filtering go hand-in-hand. You almost
always need them at the same time.

In my work as a musician, email and calendar also go together,
particularly for gig booking purposes. These days, it’s common to send
calendar invites via email.
